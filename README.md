# RenderToy

RenderToy is a scene renderer application that can load in and render custom models, shaders and lighting. You will be able to save scenes as files, load them in and then use the editor to change them as you see fit. I am currently using Dear ImGui for the UI, Assimp for model loading and glad and glfw for graphics and window functions. Below is a screenshot of how this project currently looks. It is in very early stages right now but I am steadily working towards a 1.0 release.

My reason for making this project is to become more familiar with the OpenGL graphics specification and gain a better understanding of its graphic's pipeline, as well as giving me a space to toy with and experiment with any rendering techniques that interest me in the future, hence the name.
