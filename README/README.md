# RenderToy

![alt text](https://github.com/Jamillll/RenderToy/tree/main/README/Prototype.png "Early version of RenderToy")

RenderToy is a scene renderer application that can load in and render custom models, shaders and lighting. You will be able to save scenes as files and load them in.

My reason for making this project is to become more familiar with the OpenGL graphics specification and gain a better understanding of its graphic's pipeline, as well as giving me a space to toy with and experiment with any rendering techniques that interest me in the future, hence the name.
